# Assignment 4

See the Jupyter Notebook, where we work through k-anonymity and some differential privacy mechanisms. 

You can either use your own installation of Jupyter notebook (it should be pretty straightforward to install all the required packages), or use
the provided VagrantFile to create a new VM. 

You should submit the completed Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) after completion.
